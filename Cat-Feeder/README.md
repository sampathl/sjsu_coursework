

#### Description

The repository contains all code related to the CatFeeder prototype.


#### Full documentation and report.

- Refer the report. 

#### Communication

- Slack channel (private for devs)
- Canvas discussions. (questions with professor)


#### Dependencies.

We have tried to use the open source software at almost all the places in our design. The free-tier services of AWS/IBM Bluemix are used extensively in the prototype. 

The following is the stack used for the prototype.

Web server :
- Node js and React.js library.

Datastore :
- MongoDB setup in a three node cluster with high availability and replication.

Raspberry Pi :
- Raspbian OS (Jesse)


#### Bugs

- We will be using Github Issues for bugs.


#### FUTURE SCOPE

- After collecting enough amount of data, analytics can be provided and suggestions on the feed quantity and timings can be provide to the user.
- Developing mobile applications for ease of use. 
- Feeder can be made more accurate, informative if sensors are implemented for the feed quantity available, real time feeding cat patterns.  
- Converting the pie to a circuit which caters the required functionalities and minimizing the costs.
- Using lighter materials for the casing as well as the weight plates.
